Music is the greatest invention humans have ever created. It's astonishing how creating sound through different means into aesthetically satisfying orders and pitches has stood the test of time and been recorded for most of recorded history. I have been singing since I could speak, and listening since before I was even born. I was in choir all throughout high school and throughout half of junior high, starring in musicals, plays, and All-State choruses throughout high school as well.
