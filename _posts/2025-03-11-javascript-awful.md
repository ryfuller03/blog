This week was pretty rough and hectic, so I did not get to work as much as I wanted to. That's okay, I'll make up for it next week. I mostly focused on trying to get the resources to show up and it has not been proving easy or successful. The problem is stemming from the JavaScript on the page not correctly picking up the value stored in the textbookRadio button and instead just setting it to 0 instead. I have no idea why, but here we are.

This was a stressful and frankly tough 7 days, so I hope to get more done in our meeting tomorrow and throughout the next week.
