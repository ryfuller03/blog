excerpt: "Presenting our Demo Website to the Class"

In class today, we presented the demo of our Music Attendance website for the Hendrix Music Department. It's essentially a first draft of the website, so it looked just like a standard Razor Pages website, but it works! Our implementation of the database is really tight already, which means we won't have to spend as much time restructuring later. My initial roles were client communication and front-end AJAX deployment. I have still been the primary form of communication between our team and the client, sending emails asking questions and setting up meetings and such. However, I still have not encountered when I would use AJAX in the Razor Pages website. So, instead, I've been working on structuring the classes and more of the back-end of the database, making sure the seed data shows up correctly and that it all looks neat and clean under the hood. Elliot has been helping me with that, as well.

Regarding the second client meeting, I was the one who set it up (booking the room, emailing back and forth with the professor to get a time nailed down, etc.) and the primary person presenting the website. Elliot took notes, and Mason was asking questions. It was incredibly productive, mostly because of how specific our client was with her requests.

Future plans revolve around deploying it with Azure, which will most likely fall into my lap in terms of our roles now. Additionally, adjusting the back-end of the website will be reall important, as well, as I am assuming we'll have to restructure the priority of the different parameters/variables of the classes. All in all, though, I know having the role of back-end management will really help me with future jobs and experiences. I'm excited to keep working on this project and I look forward to seeing my web app development skills growing!
