excerpt: "We know more about SOS/SOAR services!"

This week ended tumultuously with a days-long migraine that still has not completely let up. I am planning on being in the meeting tomorrow, but am not completely sure if I will be up for it. Either way, I tried my best to get things done this week, and Zoie and I got some great information from the head of SOS and SOAR regarding where she would like the website to go.

We learned a lot about what SOS and SOAR offer, such as meals, clothing, emergency medical assistance, and more. This expands the scope of the website quite a bit, but in a good way--there is gonna me much more that we can do to make a change for anyone who needs these services, and it will be a blast making it as accessible as possible for those in need.

I added a few features to the miscellaneous request page, but it will need a ginormous makeover to essentially become the main request form for every service offered. This is what I was going to work on this week, but I was hit with a nasty migraine that lasted a few days and is still residually affecting me. Either way, I will be putting more effort into the request page this week and making it everything it needs to be for our next steps!
