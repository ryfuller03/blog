THE WEBSITE ACTUALLY WORKS!!!

This is the most fulfilled in a project I have felt in a long time. The website is actually running. It turns out we still are unsure what the issue exactly is, as Elliot is now dealing with it, but all it took was deconstructing the entire website, adding the entity framework and identity stuff back in, and now it is *almost* working as it was when it was only working on one of our machines. Now, Zoie just needs to add the identity stuff back in, and we can begin development on adding in database stuff more thoroughly. (The framework for it is there, it's just not completely implemented and it looks ugly.)

Elliot is still having trouble, but we're actively working through it. I am just glad that it is up on my screen and Zoie's--that's 1 more than before!
