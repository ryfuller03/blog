Last week, I was stressing about making calls to the database and all that, but it really did not need to be that complicated. Elliot beautifully suggested that we could just use the logic from the already-working Create/Edit pages to
submit a Request to the Requests database, and that works perfectly! Requests are now popping up in the right place--at least, they were.

Now, we have an issue where, when creating or editing, the changes are not saved to the database at all. For some reason, I also can't find anything in the console logs saying anything went wrong while running the website, so I'm just really not sure what is going on. We're working on it and trying to figure it out, but it's been a little rough.

All in all, I am still glad Elliot made that proposition, because once this works, we will be LEAPS ahead of where we were. Just a little more difficulty and this website is going to be awesome.
