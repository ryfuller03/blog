This was a wild week with a very slim amount of progress relative to the amount of time spent on the issues at hand. One of the most confusing aspects of the SOS Resources project was its bizarre file structure. The website itself and its database components are completely separate, so ensuring they will click together well has been proving to be a bit of a challenge.

I began the week by just trying to un-separate the two, but it turns out it is not that simple. Because they both are technically their own separate programs, they must be combined into one. Furthermore, it seems the database was not quite fully developed, which also proved to make quite a few problems.

I then got in a call with another Disco Tray developer and worked through trying to get our repositories lined up. This call was about an hour long and while it was somewhat successful, the issue was still not solved. After we hung up, I continued to work and eventually got our problem sorted out, but that made new problems, and thus the cycle continues. This following week will be heavily dedicated to just getting everything working that was working before merging the actual project and the database compartment. I am proud of refining my debugging skills more, but wish there was more to show for it. A productive week with not much to present.
