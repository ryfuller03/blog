title: "Database Troubles Resolved"

excerpt: "We did it!"

Though most of this work week was fall break, Zoie and I focused almost exclusively on getting everything up and running, similar to last week. I was not feeling well, so I stayed behind for the weekly meeting and participated in my apartment, but most of it was just trying to get all of the database aspects of the website working so the rest could run. Though it took a while, Zoie eventually got the website working with the database pieces intact so that we can use them later, which is a huge relief!

Unfortunately for me, it took a little more work to get things running. Zoie had to send me her work and I had to merge it into my branch, then make a pull request to merge all of my new changes into the main repository for SOS. This was a bit of a hassle, but it all worked out eventually and now we are ready to present for the meeting tomorrow!

Overall a pretty turbulent week, especially trying to get things working over fall break without any assistance from any other developers, but it gave me a chance to strengthen my debugging and problem solving skills that I would not have had otherwise. Regardless, it's a great week because the website is working!
