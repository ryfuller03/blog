This week, I was able to recover from my migraine and get a lot of work done on the request form page. I first started by adding a field to submit your first and last name. I then added a checkbox to state whether or not this person's request would need a 24-hour turnaround, as SOS requested, and then adjusted the text box of the requested resource to look more in line with the text box of the reason as to why they need the resource. (The reason text box is not final, just an addition I thought they may want to justify funding for their website. That is a personal assumption that I will clear up in a later meeting with SOS.)

After adding these fields, I realized that, with the authentication we are adding to website, it would be unnecessary for the person to enter their first and last name, as it would already be in the system when they sign in with their Hendrix Microsoft account. So, I removed that field, and instead added a clarification field for what kind of services the person is requesting.  Whether it be personal care, hygiene, or over-the-counter medicine, this field will help SOS narrow down exactly what kind of help this person is requesting, just in case they aren't super clear in their request text box.

Again, because I am inferring these will be helpful, a meeting with SOS will be mandatory to ensure these features are what they want. However, I am proud of the work I have been able to get done this week, even with the awful migraines I was experiencing throughout last week. It was highly productive, and I look forward to keeping this momentum up in the coming months.
