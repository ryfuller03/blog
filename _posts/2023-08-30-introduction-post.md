Making this blog was not that difficult! The overall process was pretty straight forward. Getting things set up through Github and organizing the files in the minima layout was new, but nothing too hard to comprehend and work out. I am still confused, however, how [this blog](https://ryfuller03.github.io/blog) is linked to my [Github Page](https://ryfuller03.github.io). I understand that Github does it for you, but I still want to know *how* it exactly works.

Here's a list of things I am looking forward to:

- Getting to record my progress through this blog and show others how my work is coming along
- Getting to work in the real world in the Databases side of this course
- Understanding HTML and CSS more comprehensively
- Looking at websites' code and understanding how it is laid out

I cannot wait for the next entry! See you all then.
