title: First Week as a Disco Tray Member

I just became a member of Disco Tray Studios at Hendrix! It's a team of student developers led by one of our professors that works on different apps and websites for our school and other clients. My first assignment is a website for the Hendrix Student Outreach Services (SOS) Program, and I am ecstatic to get started! It's a bit bumpy right now, though, as I can't debug the website because of this odd error:

<span>
<img src="../images/folderfile.png" width=1000>
</span>

Changing that parameter to be a folder instead of a file could be pretty detrimental for the other team members working on the project, breaking their launch.json and .csproj files, so I am going to ask around and see what I can do about it at our next meeting tomorrow.

Other than that, I updated the README of the SOS repository on Github just to ease into things, and added a picture of myself to the Disco Tray website to make things more official. This coming week, I hope to get the debugging stuff fixed and start making more substantial contributions to the Hendrix SOS project. For now, I will continue searching for other alternatives to fixing this issue I am having. A great first week back at Hendrix, and a calm, welcoming start to this new journey!
