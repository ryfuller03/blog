Man database stuff is tough. This whole week has just been trial and error: find a new solution to the problem, it doesn't work, rinse and repeat. We are trying to display the name of the resources in the dropdown menu of the request form page, which menas connecting the resources database set to it and that is way easier said than done. Once that's complete, the page is pretty much finished, as the submit button just needs that information to put it into the database.

This week was draining, just trying over and over and not succeeding. But we will not give up. We will prevail. Job's not finished brother. Stand tall.
