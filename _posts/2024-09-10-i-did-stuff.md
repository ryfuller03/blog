title: I Did Stuff!

excerpt: "I started doing things!"

This was my second week as a Disco Tray Developer and I actually began doing things! Dr. Goadrich and I spent most of last Wednesday debugging the Hendrix SOS Resources website to ensure we could run a demo and begin changing things in it, and everything started working once we took a step back (literally).

So, I began working on my first few assignments, the first one being a miscellaneous request page for SOS, which went really well. It took a bit to get back into the swing of things with HTML, as I haven't written any in a bit, but it's a pretty straightforward language once you've written in it a bit (and also if you've taken a course about it).

My other assignment was really easy: just updating a .gitignore file so the bin and obj folders wouldn't update on every single commit I made. To make any more progress on the SOS website, though, I feel as though I need to meet with someone in the department and go over exactly what they are looking for. The final presentation left what SOS does pretty vague, and the website is also vague--I assume to ensure anyone's needs are met--so a discussion with them would be really helpful. Overall a great week that made me even more invested into this project than before!
