For Lab 6, we were asked to create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and model some data regarding a grocier who desires a database and website with specific requests. Below is a description of what we were asked to model:

</span>

With this information, we were first asked to make an ERD, as pictured below:

</span>

And here is the SQL Schema created in Vertabelo:

</span>

I am thoroughly satisfied with the models I have created. They probably aren't perfect, but I believe they very well represent what the client would want and how all the pieces would work and interact with each other. Some complications that could arise in actual implementing this database system could be if the customer could order without having an account; there would have to be a temporary customer account built around the information they input when checking out. Furthermore, there could be difficulty in implementing the desired item versus the actual item and how the actual item's information is communicated to the customer. Either way, this was a really fun assignment and I am excited to create models for future projects!
