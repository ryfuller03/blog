For Lab 8, we were tasked with following a Razor Pages tutorial and then creating our own on something we find interesting. Obviously, for me, it was video games, so I made a short and sweet little database with my favorite video games of all time.

Unfortunately, we don't have the tools and know-how yet to host this database remotely, so though the code is available through <a href="https://github.com/ryfuller03/csci340lab7">this Github Repo</a>, it can only be hosted locally, so I provided some pictures below to help you visualize what it looks like.

This is what the home page of the website looks like:

<span class="image fit">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/databasehomepage.png">
</span>

Pretty simple, nothing special, but all the links do work! And here's what the database itself looks like:

<span class="image fit">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/videogamesdatabase.png">
</span>

You can create new items and edit, view details, and delete existing ones. Pretty cool!

As for the Razor Pages tutorial, the easiest parts were definitely the steps just asking us to copy and paste code into a new file or just run a few terminal commands. The tutorial also explained what each line did, so it was really easy to follow.

The most difficult aspect of the database to translate was making a new C# class of the *thing* we're interested in. Though I chose video games, which had some similar attributes to the tutorial's *thing* (movies), getting the order right of when to run some of the terminal commands and where to edit file names within them to ensure that the Videogame.cs class I made wouldn't be overwritten was a little tricky.

While building the Razor Page, I did notice similarities between it and the Jekyll pages we've built. There is still a lot of html written to ensure the page is formatted correctly and everything looks good, and there are even link references to jquery. There are also still **.css** and **.js** files dictating the style, which are, of course, referenced in the header. However, the files themselves are not just **.html** files, they're split into **.cshtml** and **.cshtml.cs** files, where one is more html-heavy and the other more C#-heavy. It was interesting learning how these different mechanisms worked, and I'm glad the tutorial made it easy to follow and understand.

Overall, I feel pretty confident in making another Razor application. I feel as though I have the order of running commands and editing code down, and I'm excited to keep learning about this new kind of database and how to host it remotely!
