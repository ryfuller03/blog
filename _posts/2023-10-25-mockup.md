### Mockup Day
For Mockups Day, we presented the visual mockups we created using <a href="https://moqups.com">this website</a>. I was sick this day in class, so I was not there to present it, but I helped build the form view and adjust some of the other pages presented in-class. For the demo, we are still in the process of creating it and we will be able to display what we have created in-class later in November, which I'm really excited for!

For future plans, I want to be more involved in the back-end development/management, since one of my assigned jobs is AJAX development. Now that we're working with Razor Pages rather than static webpages, I'm not sure where AJAX is going to be used. So, I'd like to be most involved in developing and structuring the database in the background to fulfill that role in a different context.

Overall, I'm extremely happy with our progress and excited to keep working on this project!
