excerpt: "Adding spiffy features!"

This week, I attempted to schedule a meeting with the head of Student Outreach Services (SOS), but ended up only getting a meeting in the hour before next week's Disco Tray scheduled meet time (tomorrow). They were super busy last week, so I mostly did some cleanup and added new features to the Request Form to make it more interactive and dynamic with what the user does.

Now, there is a dedicated dropdown menu for textbooks! Whenever we get the database stuff figured out, it will be able to connect there and make the student's process of getting the textbook they need much easier. Also, the text box that asks what the student is specifically requesting gets removed, as it's not really relevant if they can just choose a textbook from a menu. It will switch between the two depending on what is selected in the top dropdown menu, making it just a more fluid experience.

Pretty slow week because of scheduling conflicts, but I'm proud of the work I did. I'm glad I got to take a closer look at the site that I was building and think more about what would be best for the user, rather than making something that's just functional. That's a trap I find myself falling into sometimes when designing websites, and I'm happy to have broken through it here. Cannot wait for the meeting tomorrow so Zoie and I can keep this project going!
