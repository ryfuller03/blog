I spent most of this week working on trying to get the pagination to work properly, but it's been pretty difficult. The pagination given in the ASP.NET tutorials depends on refreshing the page to apply a new paging "filter", so it's a matter of either trying to keep the category filter on while the page reloads, or reworking pagination to only reload the table rather than the entire page.

Trying to rework the paging proved to be a challenge, and took up a majority of what I worked on this week. Not much progress was made, but I got a much better understanding of how pagination works within ASP.NET website tables. Overall it was a great learning week and next week should prove to be more progressive!
